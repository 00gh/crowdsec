crowdsec (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Bump copyright years.
  * Bump golang-github-facebook-ent-dev build-dep.
  * Swap Maintainer/Uploaders: the current plan is for me to keep in touch
    with upstream to coordinate packaging work in Debian. Help from fellow
    members of the Debian Go Packaging Team is very welcome, though!
  * Fix typos in the long description, and merge upstream's review.
  * Refresh patch:
     + 0001-use-a-local-machineid-implementation.patch

crowdsec (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release (Closes: #972573): start by shipping binaries,
    while better integration is being worked on with upstream:
    documentation and assisted configuration are coming up.
  * Version some build-deps as earlier versions are known not to work.
  * Use a local machineid implementation instead of depending on an
    extra package:
     + 0001-use-a-local-machineid-implementation.patch
  * Use a syntax that's compatible with version 1.6.0 of the sqlite3
    driver:
     + 0002-add-compatibility-for-older-sqlite-driver.patch
  * Backport upstream fix for golang-github-docker-docker-dev version
    currently in unstable:
     + 1001-fix-docker-container-creation-for-metabase-563.patch
  * Install all files in the build directory so that the testsuite finds
    required test data that's scattered all over the place.
  * Add systemd to Build-Depends for the testsuite, so that it finds
    the journalctl binary.
  * Add lintian overrides for the hardening-no-pie warnings: PIE is not
    relevant for Go packages.
