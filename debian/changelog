crowdsec (1.0.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Initial release (Closes: #972573): start by shipping binaries,
    while better integration is being worked on with upstream:
    documentation and assisted configuration are coming up.
  * Version some build-deps as earlier versions are known not to work.
  * Use a local machineid implementation instead of depending on an
    extra package:
     + 0001-use-a-local-machineid-implementation.patch
  * Use a syntax that's compatible with version 1.6.0 of the sqlite3
    driver:
     + 0002-add-compatibility-for-older-sqlite-driver.patch
  * Backport upstream fix for golang-github-docker-docker-dev version
    currently in unstable:
     + 1001-fix-docker-container-creation-for-metabase-563.patch
  * Install all files in the build directory so that the testsuite finds
    required test data that's scattered all over the place.
  * Add systemd to Build-Depends for the testsuite, so that it finds
    the journalctl binary.
  * Add lintian overrides for the hardening-no-pie warnings: PIE is not
    relevant for Go packages.
